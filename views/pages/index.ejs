                    <p>So after a whole summer of interning in St. Paul at Navegate and taking a summer course as well, 
                        I finally got around to build this blog page for myself as I travel abroad for the fall semester to
                        Salzburg, Austria! During my intership, I learned a crap ton about web based programming languages and
                        and the elements of web development. I know blogs are super cliche, but I thought this would be a unique 
                        and cool way to share some of my experiences and photos with anyone who gives a shit!  I was able to 
                        completely develop this site from the ground up. I implemented all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a 
                        Nodejs app as well as allocated a MongoDB for a database and connected it to MongoLab to store all of my data 
                        on the cloud. I finally tied up the application by hosting the website on a Heroku server and bought the domain from Google Domains. Oh, and 
                        since this is my first solo web project, don't expect this blog to function like a dream or look like a piece of art ;)
                        <br><br>Anyways, that's all I got for you guys. Hope you enjoy the blog that I developed and the content
                        that is soon to come. With all of that...<br><br>thanks for stopping by,<br>Danny Fritz<br><br>
