                <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
                <br>
                <p>So finally after a whole summer of interning and learning new web based programming languages, I decided
                    to put my skills to use to build this blog page for myself as I travel abroad for the fall semester to
                    Salzburg, Austria! I know blogs are super cliche, but I thought this would be a unique and cool way to
                    share some of my experiences and photos with anyone who gives a shit! Oh, and since this is my first
                    solo web project, don't expect this blog to function like a dream or look like a piece of art ;)
                    <br><br>Anyways, that's all I got for you guys. Hope you enjoy the blog that I developed and the content
                    that is soon to come. With all of that...<br><br>thank you,<br>Danny Fritz
